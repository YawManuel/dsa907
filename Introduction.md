## For a JavaScript data structures and algorithms for personl skills enhancing & interview test, focus on:

1. **Core Data Structures**
   - Arrays & Strings (sliding window, two-pointer techniques)
   - Linked Lists (singly, doubly, fast/slow pointers)
   - Stacks & Queues (including monotonic stack/queue)
   - Hash Tables (Objects & Maps) (frequency counters, two-sum problems)
   - Graphs (BFS, DFS, adjacency list/matrix, Dijkstra’s algorithm)
   - Trees & Binary Search Trees (traversals, recursion, depth-first, breadth-first search, AVL, Red-Black Trees)
   - Heaps & Priority Queues (Min/Max Heap, heap sort)
   - Tries (Prefix Trees) (autocomplete, word search)
2. **Algorithms**
   - Sorting (Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Heap Sort, Bubble/Selection/Insertion Sort)
   - Searching (Binary Search, BFS, DFS, Interpolation Search)
   - Recursion & Backtracking (permutations, combinations, subset problems)
   - Dynamic Programming (memoization, tabulation, common DP problems like Fibonacci, Knapsack, Longest Common Subsequence)
   - Greedy Algorithms (coin change, activity selection, Huffman coding)
   - Bit Manipulation (XOR tricks, power of two, bit masking)
3. **Problem-Solving Strategies**
   - Sliding Window (max subarray sum, longest substring without repeating chars)
   - Two Pointers (sorted arrays, linked lists, palindrome check)
   - Divide and Conquer (merge sort, quick sort)
   - Fast & Slow Pointers (cycle detection, middle of linked list)
   - Union-Find (Disjoint Set) (connected components, Kruskal’s algorithm)
   - Topological Sorting (DAG, course schedule problem)
4. **System Design Basics (Optional)**
   - Basics of designing scalable systems
   - API design, caching, rate-limiting
5. **JavaScript-Specific Knowledge**
   - Callbacks, Promises, and Async/Await
   - Closure, Hoisting, Prototypes, and Event Loop
   - ES6+ Features (destructuring, spread/rest operators, arrow functions)
   - Performance optimization (Big-O complexity, memory management)
6. **Mock Interviews & Practice**
   - LeetCode (focus on medium/hard problems)
   - CodeSignal, HackerRank, or Turing’s coding challenges
   - Mock interviews with peers or platforms like Pramp, Interviewing.io
